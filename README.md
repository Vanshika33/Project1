Hex color is a six-digit code representing the amount of red, green, and blue that makes up the color. Hex color generator gives the hex code of selected color.

Approach:

To select a color, we will use <input type=”color”> which creates a color picker.
Get the value returned by color picker.(Color picker returns hex value)
Set the color as background and display the hex code.
